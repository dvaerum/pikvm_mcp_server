# Node.js → Rust port: honest scope, effort, and expected performance impact

Status: PLANNING ONLY (task_721cb397235a). No porting work has started or is
recommended to start from this doc alone.

## TL;DR recommendation

**Do not pursue a full port.** The measured bottleneck (task_78184455df4e:
inference via onnxruntime-node is 95-97% of request time, JS overhead ~3%) is
already native code regardless of host language — a Rust rewrite of the
orchestration layer cannot make onnxruntime's own C++ kernels run faster. Best
case, eliminating ALL JS overhead entirely (impossible in practice) buys
~3% off the dominant hot paths. Against that: 19,083 non-test LOC, 1240 tests,
and months of hard-won mover/HID-safety bugs (several caught by real hardware
gates *this session alone* — see below) that a rewrite risks silently
reintroducing. That is a bad trade. If a genuine, narrow latency-sensitive
angle turns up later (see §2), it deserves its own small, separately-scoped
investigation — not bundled into "rewrite everything."

## 1. Scope: JS-only logic vs. already-native-delegated

Real measurement, not estimate:

- **19,083 non-test LOC** across 48 files (`find src -name '*.ts' | grep -v
  __tests__ | xargs wc -l`).
- **11 files** import `onnxruntime-node` or `sharp` directly: `client.ts`,
  `cursor-ml-detect.ts`, `cursor-detect.ts`, `curve-mover.ts`, `snapshot.ts`,
  `brightness.ts`, `template-set.ts`, `hid-diagnosis.ts`, `health-check.ts`,
  `pointer-accel.ts`, `ipad-region-detect.ts`.
- The two largest files by LOC — `move-to.ts` (2747) and `index.ts` (2513) —
  are **orchestration**, not compute: correction-loop control flow, MCP tool
  schema/dispatch, HTTP client calls to kvmd. Per the task's own cited
  profiling, this class of code is exactly the ~3% that's already cheap.
- The genuinely CPU-bound work — cascade grid search, ONNX tensor
  construction/inference, JPEG decode/encode — already runs through
  `onnxruntime-node`/`sharp`'s native bindings from ALL 11 of those files. A
  Rust port would call the *same* onnxruntime C++ library through a different
  FFI boundary; the kernels themselves don't get faster.
- I did not find a hot path that profiling missed. The other 37 files are
  protocol/business logic (MCP tool definitions, HID recovery state machines,
  calibration bookkeeping, prompt text) — I/O- or control-flow-bound, not
  CPU-bound, so language choice doesn't move their wall-clock meaningfully.

**Conclusion**: there is no large hidden JS-only compute cost to "unlock" by
porting. The 95-97/3% split already accounts for essentially the whole
codebase's shape.

## 2. Where a port could realistically help (if anywhere) — real measurements

Tested the three non-inference angles the task asked me to check, on this
exact machine, rather than asserting from priors:

- **Process startup**: `time node dist/index.js --target ipad` to the
  `"PiKVM MCP Server running (stdio)"` marker measured **172-259ms** across 2
  cold runs. This is a ONE-TIME cost per server process, not per-request —
  the MCP server is long-lived (started once, serves the whole session), so
  a faster cold start (a compiled Rust binary would plausibly start in
  single-digit ms) saves at most a few hundred ms **once**, not per-operation.
  Given a single `move_to` on real Pi4 hardware currently costs 13-27
  **seconds** (post-PR93), a ~200ms one-time startup saving is not where the
  user-felt latency lives.
- **Memory footprint**: `/usr/bin/time -l` on a running server (3s after
  spawn, before any request) measured **~108MB max RSS**
  (113,459,200 bytes). Some of this is V8/Node's own baseline (a Rust binary
  would trim this part meaningfully), but a large and *language-independent*
  share is onnxruntime's own native runtime + loaded model weights, which a
  Rust build would load via the identical C++ library and pay the same cost
  for. I did not isolate the V8-only share precisely — a more rigorous
  follow-up would run the same measurement with the ONNX model unloaded to
  isolate the baseline, but the qualitative conclusion (some real savings,
  bounded by the native runtime's own footprint) doesn't require that
  precision to be actionable: 108MB is not currently a reported problem
  (nothing in this session's profiling or bug history has been memory-
  pressure-driven), so this is a "nice to have," not a fix for a measured pain
  point.
- **GC-pause elimination for latency-SENSITIVE (not latency-DOMINANT) paths**:
  this is the one place a genuine, narrow case could exist — e.g. if HID
  emit timing has a tight tolerance where a GC pause mid-sequence could
  matter. I did not find evidence of this in the codebase or this session's
  incident history (the mover bugs found and fixed this session — N1's
  correction-loop dead-exit, the cornerTargetFromBounds P0, the streamer
  idle-stop race — were all algorithmic/logic bugs, not timing-jitter bugs).
  If this angle is worth pursuing, it should be its own targeted
  investigation (profile for GC pauses coinciding with HID emit windows) —
  not assumed and not bundled into a full-system port.
- **Maintenance/reliability, distinct from speed**: Rust's type system would
  catch a class of bugs TypeScript's structural typing doesn't (e.g., some of
  this session's null/undefined-handling edge cases). But this project
  already leans hard on runtime verification (1240 tests, live hardware gates
  every PR) specifically *because* the risk surface is physical/behavioral
  (HID/mover correctness), not type-safety gaps — the bugs this session
  actually found (N1, cornerTargetFromBounds, the streamer race) were logic
  bugs a stricter type system wouldn't have caught either. I don't see a
  strong maintenance case specific to this codebase's actual failure history.

## 3. Realistic effort estimate

- **1240 tests / 123 test files**, several ADRs, and (from this session's own
  gate history alone) at least 5 distinct hard-won hardware bugs caught only
  via live iPad-rig verification, not by offline tests: the N1 mover
  correction-loop dead-exit, the cornerTargetFromBounds P0 (a deterministic
  ~619px miss that offline tests didn't catch), the streamer idle-stop
  proxy gap, the iPad re-locking pattern, and the cascade full-region-scan
  cost itself. A rewrite in a new language, by a team not already carrying
  all of this hard-won context in their heads, has real, demonstrated risk of
  silently reintroducing some subset of these — this project's own recent
  history is the evidence, not a hypothetical.
- Porting scope, if pursued despite the recommendation above, would need to
  cover: MCP protocol handling (stdio + Streamable HTTP transports), HID/
  streamer HTTP client (`client.ts`, 897 LOC), the full mover/detection
  orchestration (`move-to.ts` 2747 + `cursor-detect.ts` 1259 +
  `cursor-ml-detect.ts` 755 + `curve-mover.ts` 450 + supporting modules),
  calibration/ballistics (699 LOC), and re-porting or re-deriving all 1240
  tests' intent (not just their assertions — many encode hard-won behavioral
  contracts, not just current-output snapshots).
- A **full** port is a multi-month effort for a team with zero domain
  familiarity advantage over the current maintainers, given the actual
  complexity lives in domain logic (mover physics, detection cascades, HID
  timing quirks) that doesn't get simpler by changing language.
- A **partial** port (e.g., just the onnxruntime/sharp-touching modules) saves
  little given §1's finding — those modules are already thin wrappers around
  native code; porting the wrapper doesn't touch the actual cost.

## 4. Honest recommendation

**No.** The dominant, measured bottleneck is already native and
language-independent; a rewrite cannot improve it further. The startup/memory
angles are real but small, one-time, and not currently the source of any
reported pain (the pain — 13-27s/move on Pi4 — is inference-cascade cost,
already addressed separately and successfully via PR93/task_484bed055820's
hint-narrowing fix, which measured a real 1.6-1.8x on-box improvement without
touching the host language at all). The maintenance/type-safety case doesn't
match this project's actual failure history (logic bugs caught by live
hardware gates, not type errors). Against a multi-month rewrite carrying
concrete risk of reintroducing several already-fixed, hard-won bugs, this is
a large investment for a small and mostly-already-realized return.

If there's appetite for a narrower speed investigation, the more promising
next step (separate from this task) would be profiling for GC-pause-vs-HID-
timing coincidence specifically, or continuing the cascade-search-cost angle
that PR93 already validated works (further tuning `HINT_WINDOW_RADIUS_PX`,
or investigating why the on-box speedup (1.6-1.8x) came in well under the
isolated-detection-call speedup ratio (5-6x) — that gap, not the host
language, is where the remaining real latency is likely still hiding).
